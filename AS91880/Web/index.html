            <h3>Code of conduct</h3>
            <p>All boys at Rathkeale are expected to adhere to the code of conduct below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Each team member must attend every practice and competition game except in the
                    case of illness or special leave. Boys are <strong>not</strong> to send messages via other students when
                    they are not available but make every effort to contact the Sports Department
                    <strong>themselves</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All students must apply for a special leave if they are to be absent from their
                    competition game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All students must apply for a special leave if they are to be absent from their
                    competition game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every boy must demonstrate a high level of sportsmanship both on and off the playing
                    field. Equipment abuse, and the physical intimidation or verbal abuse of the opposition
                    or officials will not be tolerated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All team members will wear the correct sports uniform at sports matches. No
                    jewellery, or mufti clothing is to be worn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will be no association with or the taking of drugs, solvents, tobacco or alcohol at
                    playing areas on any sports fixture or tournament. Any boy may be drug tested at a
                    National Secondary Schools Tournament
                </li>
                <li>
                    All instructions given by the school, coach or manager must be followed. It is
                    unacceptable to change arrangements without consulting the school.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The school reserves the right to withdraw a member from a school team if they do not
                    meet the school’s code of behaviour or required level of commitment to their
                    academic expectations, or if they believe they are in the incorrect team for their
                    ability, size or maturity.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Rules for Supporters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is requested that parents/supporters are not part of team talks and discussions
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is an issue, this must be put through the staff member present, not the coach and /
                    or manager
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is requested that parents/supporters do not take a player away from the team
                    environment, unless team management has granted permission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All medication must go through team management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transport to and from tournaments is planned and set in advance due to risk management
                    requirements. It will only change in emergency situations and must go through the staff
                    member present on the tournament.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prep time is set throughout a tournament to catch up on work missed while being absent
                    from school. This is compulsory for all students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The use of cell phones and I-pods are limited at these tournaments and set by the team
                    management. It is inappropriate to expect your son to have access to these items at all
                    times
                </li>
            </ul>
